BS Balduran's Seatower Modification (BST) is a mod for BGT, BG:EE, and EET, adding a new area to Baldur's Gate City, with several larger and small quests and encounters inside the new city district as well as related additions to the existing areas.


## DESCRIPTION

The Seatower Area is accessible via the far south-west corner of the Docks Disrict. After visiting once, it is accessible via the worldmap.
In the Early Access Open Beta there is also a direct travel trigger from the docks to the seatower area.

Note: After installation of the EAOB, you need to play a new game or at least a save where you did not visit the BG City Areas before.
The Seatower Area is reachable via a direct travel trigger from the south-west corner of the Docks.
For a new game, the Seatower Area will also be on the worldmap.
