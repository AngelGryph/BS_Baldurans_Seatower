// Halfslinger's Ale
@730 = ~Halfslinger's Ale

Tomi of Gullykin has somehow persuaded me to get him a mug of ale from the cook and in return he will give me the copy of the Arla's Dragonsbane sling. He said I'd be better asking the cook's apprentice for the ale first, which makes me sure that there's more to this than a simple request.~
@731 = ~Halfslinger's Ale

Halfslinger got his ale and after the run-in with the cook I told him he could get his own in future. The sling wasn't worth the effort it took to get it.~

I received a mug of ale for Halfslinger in the Seatower.~

// The Tanner's Troubles

It seems that the tanner is being bullied by the guards just because he is a gnome. I said I'd to talk to the garrison commander about it.~

Captain Dungarth has promised that the tanner will not be bullied in future. I'm sure the tanner would be delighted to hear that.~

Captain Dungarth has said that he will talk to the garrison guard about the bullying but couldn't promise to stop it. I guess the tanner would still be happy to hear about it.~
@743 = ~The Tanner's Troubles

Captain Dungarth won't do anything about the bullying, and I am pretty sure it's because I'm a gnome. Problems at the bottom always results from the top, hm? Well, I could tell the tanner about it, I suppose.~
@744 = ~The Tanner's Troubles

I told the tanner that Captain Dungarth wouldn't do anything about his problem with the garrison guards.~
@745 = ~The Tanner's Troubles

I told the tanner that Captain Dungarth had promised to stop the garrison guards from bullying him.~
@746 = ~The Tanner's Troubles

I told the tanner that Captain Dungarth said he'd have a word with the garrison troops but couldn't promise to stop the bullying.~

It seems that the tanner is being bullied by the guards just because he is a gnome.~

//The Stolen Ilmater's Alms
@750 = ~The Stolen Ilmater's Alms

I found the trunk with the stolen gold. I could return it to the abbot of the Ilmater Monastery, if I want to.~
@751 = ~The Stolen Ilmater's Alms

I returned what was left of the stolen gold to the Monastery. The abbot offered to heal me once completely without taking any pay. Depending on when I will call on this offer, this could be a very generous reward.~
@752 = ~The Stolen Ilmater's Alms

I decided to keep the stolen gold.~



//Myconides in the Seatower Prison
@753 = ~Myconides in the Seatower Prison

A Prison Guard told me that there is a spore colony with angry Myconides in the Seatower Dungeons.~

@754 = ~Myconides in the Seatower Prison

I killed the Myconides and destroyed the spore colony in the Seatower Dungeon.~



// The Mysterious Scroll
@760 = ~The Mysterious Scroll

The mage Klaus has given me a strange scroll. The letters will not stand still on the page and it is quite unreadable. He said it opens a dungeon in old ruins in the Wood of Sharp Teeth. He seemed also quite desperate to save someone who is trapped inside. Maybe I can show this to someone versed with magic who can tell me more about it and give me a better starting point where to look for these ruins.~
@761 = ~The Mysterious Scroll

The mage Klaus has given me a strange scroll. The letters will not stand still on the page and it is quite unreadable. He seemed also quite desperate to save someone who is trapped inside. It has some Thayan notes on it, though. Edwin says he recognises the work and that the message says something about the ruins of a temple in Peldvale. Perhaps we should investigate Tazok's old camp site, there were some ruins there.~
@762 = ~The Mysterious Scroll

Halbazzar Drin has identified where the scroll must be used. It's the old temple ruins in Peldvale where Tazok set up his camp.~
@763 = ~The Mysterious Scroll

I got entry to the labyrinth the Thayan scroll talked about.~
@764 = ~The Mysterious Scroll

I met a man inside the labyrinth under the Bandit Camp ruins. He seems to be the one the mage Klaus wanted us to save. We could indeed save him from the clutches of a Nabassu Fledgling. Once I found the exit myself, I could see whether he found each his way to Klaus.~
@765 = ~The Mysterious Scroll

I found my way out of that labyrinth and learnt some weird things about my future life, or at least got a little glimps of things I don't understand yet.~

@766 = ~The Mysterious Scroll

I found my way out of that labyrinth and learnt some weird things about my future life, or at least got a little glimps of things I don't understand yet.
Also, Ulf found his way to Klaus savely.~


//Dark Power in the Seatower Catacombs
@774 = ~Dark Power in the Seatower Catacombs

Seems the Ilmater monastery has problems to keep the catacombs clear of whatever it is that is posing a threat down there. I should talk to the abbot to get more information.~
@775 = ~Dark Power in the Seatower Catacombs

Abbot Guoremor of the Seatower Monastery asked me to clear out the catacombs from what he called the restless spirits. He gave me two keys for the catacombs. The first one appearently leads into the main catacombs, whereas the second one is for a hidden door that leads to the "real evil". He told me to leave the dead alone or more spirits will stirr, but maybe that would be an option to clear out the catacombs for real - if I want to fight that much, that is. Any way - he told me to be prepared for a "great evil".~
@776 = ~Dark Power in the Seatower Catacombs

I got a reward from Abbot Guoremor after clearing out the Seatower Catacombs.~

//An Orphan in the Seatower
@777  = ~An Orphan in the Seatower

Inside the Balduren's Seatower Inn I met a man who is travelling with a boy. The boy should appearently be picked up by a lady who resides on the first floor but so far did not make up her mind to really take over the boy. I could ask her what this is all about.~
@778  = ~An Orphan in the Seatower

Oh, how "unfortunate"... The grandmother declined to even see her grandson and left without taking him on, after my description of his looks which was not exactly... accurate. Well, that happens if you trust a stranger's testimony more than checking yourself. I don't think I need to feel guilty here, if people are so silly!~
@779  = ~An Orphan in the Seatower

This was heartwarming. The grandmother took on her grandson, and I think they will do fine.~

//Cage the Rabbits
@780  = ~Cage the Rabbits

Inn Master Roryn gave me a cage where I can put in the rabbits from the third floor of the Seatower. He'll pay me 50 gold for everyone I bring back in the cage.~

@781  = ~Cage the Rabbits

I caged as much as possible and gave Inn Master Roryn back the cage. He paid me 50 gold per rabbit as promised.~

@782  = ~Cage the Rabbits

I lost interest in chasing rabbits and gave Inn Master Roryn back the cage.~


//Strange Happenings in Room No. 3.4
@785  = ~Strange Happenings in Room No. 3.4

A rather upset inn guest talked about rats running all over the third floor of the Seatower. If I understand one thing about rats, finding them on the third floor and not in the cellar would be a strange coincidence.~
@786  = ~Strange Happenings in Room No. 3.4

Now I have been warned not to open a door to a room on the third floor of the Seatower. The question is - do I heed the warning, or am I even more tempted to have a look?...~
@787  = ~Strange Happenings in Room No. 3.4

Er, alright. Appearently, a mage conjured rabbits inside the room in the third floor of the Seatower. Why he would do that is still a mystery, though. He got thrown out of the inn by the staff. Something tells me this is not over yet, that man seemed so desperate. I don't expect him to be any kind of threat, though, looking at all the white, fluffy rabbits running around...
I can also only assume that the rabbits were the "rats" the other guest believed to have spotted.~
@788  = ~Strange Happenings in Room No. 3.4

That mad mage is still on the seatower grounds... Waiting for me to show me what he can conjure now. Why is it always me?...~
@789  = ~Strange Happenings in Room No. 3.4

The mage Klaus found a new home in the Ilmater monastery on the seatower grounds. The monks took pity on him after he conjured a vampiric rabbit as a help for his friend.~

@790  = ~Rats in the Seatower Inn 

Roryn, the inn keeper of Seatower Inn, will give me 50 gold for every rat I find on the inn's second floor.~
@791  = ~Rats in the Seatower Inn 

I found a rat on the second floor of the Seatower Inn... and I have the suspicion there won't be any more than this one. I should take it to Roryn.~
@792  = ~Rats in the Seatower Inn 

The rat plague of the Seatower Inn turned out to be Betsy, the pet rat of the Inn Master's daughter.~

//
@793  = ~Missing Monk in the Seatower

Lenard, a soldier of the Badluran's Saetower is missing his secret lover Martina, a monk from the Seatower's Ilmater Monastery who went missing while being on an errand in town. She was last seen at the Ilmater Shrine in north east Baldur's Gate. I should go there and ask around whether anyone has seen her lately.~
@794  = ~Missing Monk in the Seatower

A beggar inside the Ilmater's Shrine suggested I'd go around ask other beggars about the missing monk Martina. I need to find the beggar who was here at the shrine when Martina was here.~
@795  = ~Missing Monk in the Seatower

A beggar in front of the Ilmater's Shrine suggested I'd ask his comrade who should be in front of the palace currently. He was at the shrine the time Martina was there and might have seen her.~
@796  = ~Missing Monk in the Seatower

A beggar in front of the palace told me that he saw a soldier following Martina behind the Ilmater's Shrine and only him coming back after a while. I surely hope this has nothing to say, but to make sure, I should have a close look behind the shrine myself? If we are dealing with a crime, I fear I need proof before reporting to anyone.~
@797  = ~Missing Monk in the Seatower

I found Martina... She is dead. From what I know I have to believe the soldier who was sent to search for her killed her, or at least knows what happened that day behind the shrine. Lenard came here and took her remains back to the tower. He suggested I'd go back and talk to the Ilmater Monastery Abbot, and maybe the Seatower Commander would like to talk to me about this, too.~
@798  = ~Missing Monk in the Seatower

I found Martina... She is dead. The soldier who was sent to search for her killed her, and took the gold the monks collected for alms. Lenard came and took her remains. The Ilmater Monastery Abbot gave me some priest scrolls for my help.~

//The Prisoner in the Seatower Prison
@799  = ~The Prisoner in the Seatower Prison

I got word that I should talk to the Seatower Commander. He can be found in his office at the second floor of the main tower.~
@800 = ~The Prisoner in the Seatower Prison

The Seatower Commander gave me a pass which grants me entrance to the Seatower's prison in the cellar of the main tower. An arrested solder named Shuck requested to talk to me.~ 
@801 = ~The Prisoner in the Seatower Prison

I went to see the prisoner as told by the commander.~
@802 = ~The Prisoner in the Seatower Prison

The Seatower Commander told me to go into the Seatower's prison in the cellar of the main tower - an arrested solder named Shuck requested to talk to me.~ 

//Help Shuck's Brother
@805 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

Shuck, a former soldier of the Seatower and now imprisoned in the Seatower prison, asked me to help his brother who is being threatened by smugglers in Nashkel. 
To confront them, I need to find their contact south of the Lotus Tent at the Nashkel Carnival. 
Before I do that, I need to take the gold out of one of the trunks in one of the tower wall quarters - Shuck explained to me how to open the trunk so I'd find the gold. It's in the Dragon Tower, the tower south of the smithy.~
@806 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

I killed the smugglers before they could tell me where they brought Shuck's brother, so I couldn't help them.~
@807 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

I couldn't be bothered to help Shuck's brother.~
@808 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

Shuck, a former soldier of the Seatower and now imprisoned in the Seatower prison, asked me to help his brother who is being threatened by smugglers in Nashkel. 
To confront them, I need to find their contact south of the Lotus Tent at the Nashkel Carnival.~
@809 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

Shuck, a former soldier of the Seatower and now imprisoned in the Seatower prison, asked me to help his brother.
I confronted the smugglers and learned about the whereabouts of Shuck's brother. They sold the brother to slave traders! I need to confront the slavers' contact. They can be found inside the Balduran's Seatower on the top level, pretending to organize excursions into the wild. I need to ask to see the "special creatures" to be recognized as a slave "customer".~
@810 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

I killed the slave traders before the deal to buy free Shuck's brother was through, so I couldn't help them.~
@811 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

I waited too long to make the deal to buy free Shuck's brother, so I couldn't help them.~
@812 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

Buying free shuck's brother will cost 20,000 gold! I am to bring the sum to Leonhard on the top floor of the Balduran's Seatower.~
@813 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

I paid the requested sum to free Shuck's brother. He will be "delivered" to the Ilmater Monastery on the morrow! I should tell Shuck about this as soon as possible.~
@814 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

Shuck's brother Nathoriel is safe in the Ilmater Monastery. I am sure Shuck would like to know about that.~
@815 = ~Help Shuck's Brother

I freed Nathoriel, brother to imprisoned Tower Guard Shuck from the slave traders.~

//The Breach in the Seatower Prison
@816 = ~The Breach in the Seatower Prison

Behind the hole in the prison wall is a real cave, with exits to several places! I should report to Seatower Commander Airard this is not a dead end.~
@817 = ~The Breach in the Seatower Prison

I reported the findings behind the hole in the prison wall to the prisonguards, and one of them went to report to the Seatower Commander. He acted kind of weird, though... as if something was wrong with him. I should go to the commander's office in the Seatower and see for myself that the information is passed on accordingly, as it is of utmost importance to the tower's safety.~
@818 = ~The Breach in the Seatower Prison

The Seatower Commander asked me to investigate the Sea Cave under the Seatower accessible through the tower's prison. Escpecially the question whether there are more doppelgangers lurking and where they came from in the first place. If I have information, I will find him in his normal study on the second level of the tower.~
@819 = ~The Dead Adjutant

I found a dead sergeant in the Sea Caves beneath the Seatower that I entered through the opening in the prison. I should report this to the Seatower authorities! What is especially strange is that it seems to be the adjutant of the commander, who I saw only recently in the commander's office - alive.~
@820 = ~The Dead Adjutant

I found the poor dead Adjutant's body in the Sea Caves beneath the Seatower that I entered through the opening in the prison. I should report this to the Seatower Commander.~
@821 = ~The Dead Adjutant

I told the Seatower Commander about the Adjutant's body in the Sea Caves beneath the Seatower. He said he will arrange a proper burial.~
@822 = ~The Breach in the Seatower Prison

I reported everything of importance about the seacave to the Seatower Commander.~
@823 = ~The Breach in the Seatower Prison

The Seatower Commander asked me to investigate the tower's prison, and why both soldiers going down to investigate came back as doppelgangers. He suspects that I will find a breach in the wall where doppelgangers are coming in! If I have information, I will find him in his normal study on the second level of the tower.~

@832 = ~Working with the Smugglers

Holger gave me a first task: 
I need to get to know why the smugglers working inside the Seatower are no longer operating. For this, I guess I could start asking Shuck inside the prison. I also guess it doesn't matter to ask the Seatower Commander whether he is responsible, since the smuggler cell seems to have vanished.~
*/
@832 = ~Working with the Smugglers

Holger gave me a first task: 
I need to get to know why the smugglers working inside the Seatower are no longer operating. For this, I guess I just need to keep my eyes open and search around the tower as much as I am able.~
@833 = ~Working with the Smugglers

Holger gave me a second task: 
I need to deliver a sealed package to the cook of the Helm and Cloak Tavern in north west Baldur's Gate. I need to hurry as this has to be done in three days, and I am not to open the package!~
@834 = ~Working with the Smugglers

I delivered a sealed package to the cook of the Helm and Cloak Tavern in north west Baldur's Gate. The content of the box were figs!~
@835 = ~Working with the Smugglers

I delivered a package to the cook of the Helm and Cloak Tavern in north west Baldur's Gate. The content of the box were figs! I didn't do it quite right, though...~
@836 = ~Working with the Smugglers

The smugglers stopped working with me.~
@837 = ~Working with the Smugglers

I stopped working for the smugglers.~
@838 = ~Working with the Smugglers

I know why the Seatower Cell didn't communicate any more - they were all taken over by doppelgangers.~

My work with the smugglers is finished. Holger left his place near the Nashkel Carnival.~
@840 = ~Working for the Slavers

I got a message from Holger. I am supposed to talk to Leonhard 'the Fierce' on the third floor of the Seatower to get my next assignment.~

@841 = ~Working for the Slavers

I refused to help the slave traders with one of their "shipments".~

I agreed to protect one of the slavers' shipments. I am supposed to go to the western shore of the Chionthar, south of Wyrm's Crossing when night has fallen, and should not forget my weapons.~
@844  = ~Working for the Slavers

Betrayal! The slavers tried to enslave me "for the galdiator rings". Good thing I already showed Leonhard what I think about him.~
@845  = ~Working for the Slavers

Together with the Flaming Fist we busted the slavers' shipment. I don't think I'll be welcome by them any longer...~
@846  = ~Working for the Slavers

I had a last word with Leonhard for the betrayal of his men, but I decided to let him live.~
@847  = ~Working for the Slavers

Betrayal! The slavers tried to enslave me "for the galdiator rings". I guess I should have a word with Leonhard about this.~

//Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower
@860  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower

Captain of the Guard Dungarth asked me to help with identifying - and killing - doppelgangers amongst the Seatower soldiers. I should walk the tower grounds with the "Mimic Powder" Master Shizell gave me and report any doppelgangers I kill to Captain Dungarth. He and Master Shizell can be found in the Seatower barracks.~

@861  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower
The Seatower could use my help to kill the doppelgangers inside the tower grounds. Guard Dungarth and Master Shizell can be found in the Seatower barracks. If I want to help I should not wait too long, as they will not tarry to rid the tower of this threat.~
@862  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower

Might there be a more efficient way to draw out the doppelgangers on the tower grounds? If I'd find a way to spread the fumes across the area without them getting burnt, then this could speed up the process of finding the doppelgangers hiding in the Seatower.~
@863  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower

Not only Captain Dungarth but also a visitor of the tower remarked about the wind direction coming straight from the tanner's side today, spreading the smell of whatever the tanner is brewing over all the tower area...~
@864  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower

I used the tanner's tub to spread the "Mimic Powder" all across the seatower grounds. This should have lured out all doppelgangers at once. I should return to the main tower area to fight them.~
@865  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower

The doppelgangers inside the tower are defeated. I should report to the Seatower Commander to receive my reward.~
@866  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower

The doppelganger threat to the Seatower is over.~
@867  = ~Doppelgangers Inside the Seatower

I agreed to help fighting doppelgangers inside the barracks. The Captain gave me time to prepare but I should not wait too long. I should talk to the Captain inside the barracks when I'm ready to fight.~

The Seatower Tanner is interested in three bottles of exquisit liqueur. I guess any bottle of not-to-cheap high-proof beverage will do.~
@875  = ~Liqueur for the Tanner~
@876  = ~Liqueur for the Tanner

I agreed to bring three bottles of exquisit liqueur to the Seatower Tanner as compensation for his lost batch. I guess any bottle of not-to-cheap high-proof beverage will do.~

I brought the tanner in the Seatower one bottle of liqueur.~
@878  = ~Liqueur for the Tanner

I brought the tanner in the Seatower two bottles of liqueur.~
@879  = ~Liqueur for the Tanner

I brought the tanner in the Seatower all requested three bottles of liqueur.~
@880  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

The Seatower Commander was aware of the slave traders' doings inside the tower. If I could provide a witness to their schemes it would help the Flaming Fist to take them down.~
@881  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

The Seatower Commander will be interrogating Shuck's brother to get information about the slavers' doings. Next I return to the Commander he might know more about their plans.~
@882  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

I know a place *and* a date for one of the slavers' shipments. I could tell the Seatower Commander about it.~
@883  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

I agreed to help the Flaming Fist against the slavers' doings. I am supposed to go to the western shore of the Chionthar, south of Wyrm's Crossing when night has fallen. The slavers are planning a delivery there for which the Flaming Fist will set an ambush.~
@884  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

I declined to help against the slavers.~
@885  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

I brought the Seatower Commander the booklet I found with the slave trader contact. We know a *time* they are planning something now - what we still need is the *where*.~
@886  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

I brought the Seatower Commander the booklet I found with the slave trader contact. Maybe it will help the Flaming Fist in their fight against the slavers although it only contains cryptic listed dates.~
@887  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

The Flaming Fist is now approaching the slavers from the south, while I should go to the meeting point from the north and prevent the slaver mercenaries to escape. I should ready my weapons and hurry!~
@888  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

Together with the Flaming Fist we stopped this slavers' sipment and freed the enslaved commoners. I should talk to the Seatower Commander about this success.~
@889  = ~Confront the Slave Traders in Baldur's Gate

Together with the Flaming Fist we stopped this slavers' sipment and freed the enslaved commoners. I got a reward from the Seatower Commander.~

@900  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom~

There is a fire elemental in the storeroom adjacent to the Seatower Kitchen. The cook unlocked the door so I can take care of it - somehow.~
@902  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

I put the fire elemental into the huge beacon flame. It should be able to return to its home plane now.~
@903  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

I killed the fire elemental by drowning it in the tower well.~
@904  = ~Fire Elemental in Seatower Storeroom

The Tower Beacon Guard implied the solution to put the fire elemental into the beacon flame on top of the tower - if we manage to find a container that will hold it for the transport.~
@905  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

I killed the fire elemental.~
@906  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

Master Shizell, the Tower Mage, suggested the fire elemental could be put back into a fire where it would return to its home plane instead of fighting it.~
@907  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

The Seatower Guard took care of the fire elemental in the storeroom.~
@908  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

The Seatower Fletcher will coat the barrel if I bring her a Potion of Fire Resistance.~
@909  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

The barrel is fire proof now and should hold the fire elemental for at least a day.~
@910  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

I trapped the fire elemental inside the fire proof barrel. I should decide what to with it soon, as the barrel will not hold it forever.~
@911  = ~Fire Elemental in the Seatower Storeroom

I waited too long and the barrel broke. I had to kill the fire elemental.~

@1024 = ~A dark power?~
@1025 = ~So the monks say. They should keep the catacombs clean but no-one has been down there for days! They are so lazy, those monks! Pain-Bearer, fuff!!! Sleep-Weaver more like!~

@1032 = ~Do come back and visit, hmm?~
@1033 = ~Alright, what is it you need? Sandrah, priestess of Selune at your service.~
@1034 = ~Can I see your store?~
@1035 = ~What can you tell me about Selune?~
@1036 = ~Of course. One moment...~
@1037 = ~What *can't* I tell you about Our Lady of Silver? I am a priestess, after all.~

@1041 = ~What can you tell me about Shar?~
@1042 = ~That's all I wanded to know, thank you.~
@1043 = ~Selune and her sister, Shar, arose from the primordial essence of the universe. Together, they created Chauntea, embodification of Abeir-Toril, as well as all other heavenly bodies, and gave them life.~
@1044 = ~They disagreed about the fate of what they had created, and when Selune created the Sun, Shar was infuriated. From their disagreements arose many other deities; war, disease, murder.~
@1045 = ~In other words, Selune has been around for a long, long time. And in all likelihood the two of them had the very first argument in the history of the universe. Interesting little tidbit, that, I always thought.~
@1046 = ~Selune has varied and diverse worshippers, from non-evil lycanthropes to female magic users. She has three orders; the Swords of the Lady, the Oracles of the Moon, and the Silverstars. Myself, I aspire to be an Oracle, and divine the fortunes of those who need it.~

@1048 = ~Tell me more about the Oracles of the Moon.~
@1049 = ~Tell me more about the Silverstars.~
@1050 = ~Their rivalry stems from the creation of Abeir-Toril and the heavens, and what fate they wished upon them. Their disagreements created any number of other deities, including Mystryl, the original goddess of Magic. Of course, she's been succeeded by Mystra nowadays.~
@1051 = ~Was there anything else?~
@1052 = ~What else would you like to know about Selune?~
@1053 = ~Ahh, the Swords of the Lady... they're often called 'Lunatics' for a reason. They are crusaders, defending us from the evils of Shar and her minions. Not the brightest bunch, despite their important cause.~
@1054 = ~That's all I wanted to know about the orders, thank you.~
@1055 = ~The Oracles of the Moon are female diviners, much like I aspire to be, and enact fortune-telling rituals for those who need it. They are some of the most respected priestesses in Selune's care.~
@1056 = ~The Silverstars live primarily in the Dales, to the north, and dedicate themselves to the protection of the vulnerable. Those who perform exceptionally well are sometimes gifted with a Moonblade by the goddess herself, and most often become inflated with the sense of their own glory as a result.~
@1057 = ~Forgive me my little jibes. Factional poltiics is not what you asked for, it's just a little well ingrained in my psyche. One of my teachers was a 'gifted' Silverstar. Gifted, my foot.~

@1200 = ~No...~
@1201 = ~Do you know what happened the last time I found that halfling in my alestore?~
@1202 = ~He was dead drunk with his head under the tap of the best ale in Baldur's Gate an' the tap was running. Half a barrel of Golden Dragon straight down the drain! I 'ope the fish had a good party because he didn't!~
@1203 = ~Ohh, right. Are you sure..?~
@1204 = ~*sigh* Look, you seem a good sort to me.~
@1205 = ~I beg your pardon?~
@1206 = ~*If* I was to pour an ale for that halfling, it'll cost ye - five gold pieces or a kiss. I 'eard ye talking to the apprentice over there.~
@1207 = ~*KISS*~
@1208 = ~Five gold pieces it is.~
@1209 = ~That's not the first I poured, though. The first one was for the nice soldier doing the actual *work*.~
@1210 = ~*giggle* Now that was a pleasant surprise!~
@1211 = ~Look - I'm busy - very busy. Next person to disturb me gets my ladle round his ear'ole - do you understand? Food to be cooked, ale to be poured - whaddya want anyway?~
@1212 = ~The fletcher says you've got two plump geese to pluck and she'd like the feathers for her arrows.~
@1213 = ~Feathers, is it? Feathers? Pah! The apprentice there's in charge of plucking geese. It's about the only thing she can do, short of emptying the slops bucket. Go talk to her - and leave me ALONE!!!~
@1214 = ~Me, talking to a dwarf about ale...~
@1215 = ~*If* I was to pour an ale for that halfling, it'll cost ye five gold pieces.~
@1216 = ~You really don't like dwarves, do you?~
@1217 = ~"If"? What else is hindering you?~
@1218 = ~The problem is that the alestore is blocked - one 'o them damn fire things came out of the oven this morn' and I just barely managed to lock it into the storeroom. I haven't opened the door since.~
@1219 = ~A fire elemental? You have a fire elemental in the cellar?~
@1220 = ~Right, you hairy little runt!~
@1221 = ~Kagain! Back off! There's enough trouble around here already without you and your mouth causing more!~
@1222 = ~Oh.~
@1223 = ~Well now, isn't that a surprise? A dwarf with manners!~
@1224 = ~Sooo - I guess you want me to remove it for you?~
@1225 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, at your service.~
@1226 = ~So you say, but ye can still keep yer hands off my alestore!~
@1227 = ~Hey you! Dwarf! The alestore's locked so you can get your dirty carcass out of my kitchen NOW!!!~
@1228 = ~Yes, well. Be welcome then Yeslick Orothiar - but ye can still keep yer hands off my alestore!~
@1229 = ~I know it will make some damage but it's so damp down there I'm sure it won't last long. But if ye want that *ale* now ye'd have to get rid of it first.~
@1230 = ~(sigh) Know what - ye are the fighting sort, are ye not? I'll open the door for ye, maybe ye can take care of the fire creature 'n spare me the scolding from the captain, ey? But watch where ye going down there, it's to that fire monster and out again, don't ye go near the supplies - and if I see ye approaching the alestore it will be my ladle round yer ear'ole I swear!~
@1231 = ~But I haven't done anything!~
@1232 = ~Not yet you 'aven't but I know very well you're after the keys to my alestore. That's all dwarves want - drink and the more they can get, the better. And what happens when they get drunk? Trouble - that's what. And everything in sight gets broken. You want to know why I don't like dwarves? That's why!~
@1233 = ~But... but...~
@1234 = ~OUT!!!!~
@1235 = ~Didn't I tell you to get out.  I don't want any dwarf in my kitchen; can't you get that through yer thick skull.~
@1236 = ~Och, had I known you'd bring a *dwarf* into me kitchen I'd not let ye near me alestore! Make 'm behave, will ye?!~
@1237 = ~OUT of my kitchen with that fire thing NOW!!~
@1238 = ~Ye helped me fine down there, <GIRLBOY>.~
@1239 = ~I promised you a pot of ale for that *Halfslinger*. Here it is - just tell him not to come looking for any more. He's still not forgiven.~
@1240 = ~One day, Kagain, I swear by Clangeddin's Beard that mouth of yours is going to stop my axe.~
@1241 = ~Heh! An' that'll be the day the sun shines out of yer arse too. Bend over and we'll take a look, shall we?~
@1242 = ~I wouldn't want yer dirty ale if it was the last drop in Baldur's Gate and <HESHE> wouldn't either. Yer storeroom's probably got more rats in it than fleas on a mangy cur.~
@1243 = ~Shut yer yap woman. Yer making me ears hurt and me axe twitchy.~
@1244 = ~And here is an ale for you. Don't tell me ye don't want it. And don't you let that Halfslinger talk ye into givin' him that!!~
@1245 = ~Watch yer mouth woman. I 'ad a bath two years ago when I fell in the Chionthar.~
@1246 = ~Dwarf - yes, but a thief - no. I am sorry if other members of dwarfkind have given you a bad impression of all of us.~
@1247 = ~Yeslick Orothiar at your service ma'am. May Clangeddin Silverbeard give his blessing upon you.~
@1248 = ~Madam! I may be a dwarf but I assure ye I'm not dirty!~

//more lines for Fletcher (female)
@1249 = ~Listen - you wouldn't be able to do me a small favour please?~
@1250 = ~Me, neither.~
@1251 = ~That's alright - then I can still say I offer the finest arrows of Baldur's Gate *and* Purskal, because you can't prove me wrong, hm?~
@1252 = ~Now you sound like the armorer.~
@1253 = ~Alright, fine. I'll get the feathers for you.~
@1254 = ~I'm on it.~
@1255 = ~A pity though.~
@1256 = ~Oh, that's great!~
@1257 = ~I don't have time right now for extra errands.~
@1258 = ~No, not really.~
@1259 = ~Is there anything I can do for you?~
@1260 = ~[PC talking to a female] Would you coat this barrel with a fire proof layer from the inside? It needs to withhold a trapped fire elemental for a certain time.~
@1261 = ~I have all ingredients now. Please coat the barrel so that it is fire proof.~
@1262 = ~[Spelling error in name is on purpose!] "Purskal", eh?~
@1263 = ~This will only take a moment.~
@1264 = ~Here you go. It should be fire proof enough to trap a fire elemental for at least a day.~
@1265 = ~A barrel is not the wood structure I usually work with, but I am sure I could do that, yes. Bring me a potion of fire resitance and I can do it right away.~
@1266 = ~If you keep the barrel after dealing with the fire elemental go and ask Garalt - the armorer - whether he wants it. I know he always has a use for fire proof equipment.~
@1267 = ~And I see you have all needed ingredients for enchanting your barrel.~



// Halfslinger
@1280 = ~So do you want to buy any slings today or not? And I could still do with that help.~
@1281 = ~I give up. What do you want?~
@1282 = ~Just show me the goods.~
@1283 = ~No.~
@1284 = ~'Allo!~
@1285 = ~Who are you?~
@1286 = ~Be quiet! I ask the questions first.~
@1287 = ~Another halfling-hater eh? Fine. The door's that way.~
@1288 = ~Tomi. Tomi of Gullykin but mostly I gets called Halfslinger.~
@1289 = ~Halfslinger. Right. I'm not even going to ask.~
@1290 = ~Why 'Halfslinger'?~
@1291 = ~Well, good day to you, Halfslinger.~
@1292 = ~You don't hold back do you?~
@1293 = ~You could tell me what it is you could do for me.~
@1294 = ~So you make slings and what you said before was a jest at my expense.~
@1295 = ~Just like the armorer has the finest arms and armor in Baldur's Gate - and then says he'll sell them cheaper than anywhere else, I suppose.~
@1296 = ~Oh. So you've, er... made your own experiences, I gather.~
@1297 = ~Ask what?~
@1298 = ~Just forget it.~
@1299 = ~Because I'm a halfling and I'm good with the sling, you blind idiot! Huuh. How many more dumb adventurers are going to ask that question, eh?~
@1300 = ~How do you know I'm an adventurer?~
@1301 = ~I knew I was going to regret asking...~
@1302 = ~You come in here armed to the teeth and ask that?~
@1303 = ~Right... I think we're even on the dumb question score.~
@1304 = ~So what can I do for you?~
@1305 = ~What can you do for me? I haven't got a clue.~
@1306 = ~Nothing.~
@1307 = ~The name is Half-Slinger, yes? What do you think I make?~
@1308 = ~Ohhh.~
@1309 = ~You irritating little halfling. You irritating little SHORTARSE. Do you do anything but wind people up?~
@1310 = ~Just saying. You don't have to buy anything from me.~
@1311 = ~This time, I don't think I'll bother. I'll be going now.~
@1312 = ~Look, before I show you what I have for sale, can you help me? I'll give you a discount!~
@1313 = ~Just tell me it doesn't involve that bloody cook again!~
@1314 = ~How could you send me on an errand to that cook? I'M A DWARF YOU STINKING IDIOT!~
@1315 = ~Well... yes, it does.~
@1316 = ~I'm going to regret this. I know I'm going to regret this. That woman eats adventurers for a snack!~
@1317 = ~No. I'm going nowhere near that ladle-wielding harriden again. Nowhere near. NO.~
@1318 = ~I've got some lovely slings here - the best on this side of the Sword Coast. Honest. There's even a good copy of Arla's Dragonbane and it's just as deadly as the original.~
@1319 = ~Just like the fletcher has the best bows and arrows north of 'Purskal', I suppose.~
@1320 = ~NO! Just show me the goods!~
@1321 = ~All I want is a pot of ale. You could try talking to the cook's apprentice first. It might not be quite as bad as talking to the cook.~
@1322 = ~So why don't you go and ask for one?~
@1323 = ~Still, that cook guards the alestore like a dragon on a gold heap.~
@1324 = ~The problem is... the last time I wanted a pot of ale I tried to steal it and I got caught in the aleroom.~
@1325 = ~Dead drunk, I suppose?~
@1326 = ~Something like that.~
@1327 = ~If I get this pot of ale, you'll give me the copy of Arla's Dragonbane?~
@1328 = ~I think I like the idea. It's your decision how much that ale is worth to you.~
@1329 = ~A pot of ale isn't worth that much - ! Is it?~
@1330 = ~You tell me.~
@1331 = ~No, I'm not getting involved in this.~
@1332 = ~For a <RACE> you sure drive a hard bargain. Alright - the sling for the ale.~
@1333 = ~Done.~
@1334 = ~A pot of Golden Dragon ale! How did you do it? No, I don't care! A real pot of Golden Dragon - mmmmm.~
@1335 = ~I'd make that last if I were you. There's no more where that came from.~
@1336 = ~Ah, but there is - there always is!~
@1337 = ~The cook made it pretty clear that's the last ale for you for a very long time. You shouldn't show your face in the kitchen, to be precise.~
@1338 = ~*BELCH* Here's your sling an' good luck with it.~
@1339 = ~Yes.~
@1340 = ~So do you want to buy any slings today or not?~
@1341 = ~Store's over here.~
@1342 = ~[Kagain] Ale, is it? Hey, <CHARNAME> ye can get me a couple while you're at it. Six would be better.~
@1343 = ~Heh. A man after me own 'eart. Or halfling.~
@1344 = ~What is it you want?~
@1345 = ~You are the tower's interrogator?~
@1346 = ~I recognize you! You're the tower's interrogator.~
@1347 = ~Ah, yes, we met. But let me introduce myself properly, yes?~
@1348 = ~Ah, yes, we met. Well, a man has to earn a living, yes?~
@1349 = ~You have your ale - the last one I might add, at least from the cook. Now give me my sling.~
@1350 = ~Well... now you know why I'm avoiding to go into that kitchen - at least for now!~
@1351 = ~Indeed, and that's the wiser choice. There's no more where that came from.~

// Farmer's Wife
@1360 = ~Oh - hello. Are you here to investigate the strange goings-on? We heard that the Flaming Fist were going to send someone to check.~
@1361 = ~That's right. Do you know anything about it?~
@1362 = ~What do you know about it? Speak up and quickly!~
@1363 = ~So you're involved in it, are you?~
@1364 = ~Oh no, not me. And you needn't be so rude either! But my husband might know something if you speak to him nicely.~
@1365 = ~Oh no, not me. But my husband might know something if you want to talk to him.~
@1366 = ~If you want to know anything about the seatower farm then you'd best be speaking to my husband.~
@1367 = ~I just milk the cows and feed the chickens - and feed my husband, of course. You need to speak to him to learn anything about how the farm runs.~
@1368 = ~It's not a bad life, living here in the seatower. I'd hate to be down in the slums.~

// Farmer
@1370 = ~Good day to you again! Is there anything I can do to help you?~
@1371 = ~Not today.~
@1372 = ~A good day to you too. I'm the seatower farmer.~
@1373 = ~And what do you do around here? Why does the seatower need a farmer?~
@1374 = ~Oh, that's a pity, but no. My cows have special permission from the Dukes because they are the only ones allowed inside the city walls, and even if I'd go and get another one, there is almost not enough grass here for the ones I've got. I'd need to get hey from afar to feed another cow.~

//@1375 = 
//@1376 = 
//@1377 = 
//@1378 = ~Come on now - you must know more than that. You live here!~
//@1379 = ~Not I. Why would anyone want anything with me? I'm only the seatower farmer.~
//@1380 = ~Not I. Why would anyone tell me anything? I'm only the seatower farmer.~
@1381 = ~It's a bit difficult to milk the cow if the door's locked, isn't it?~
@1382 = ~Why does the seatower need a farmer? The city and all of its shops is just across the bridge.~
@1383 = ~Oh, partly tradition and partly convenience. I can provide fresh eggs and milk every day and fresh meat if given a day's notice.~
@1384 = ~That cow looks a bit skinny to me.~
@1385 = ~You don't mean you slaughter the poor cow!~
@1386 = ~On no, no! Where would I get fresh milk from then? No, I buy it in the city.~
@1387 = ~The meat in the city isn't that fresh. You can smell it three streets downwind.~
@1388 = ~I wouldn't buy it from the butchers in the city either. No, I send my son to order a fresh carcass from one of the farmers outside the city. The meat is delivered to a warehouse in the city and I pick it up from there on the same day.~
@1389 = ~Ah.~
@1390 = ~There isn't much more to tell really. I keep the grass to a reasonable level if the cow can't and I do a few odd jobs around the seatower.~
@1391 = ~Thank you.~
@1392 = ~Mind where you're putting your feet - ! Too late. The cow's been a bit sickly lately, I'm afraid.~
@1393 = ~Never mind. I've seen worse on the inside of gnolls.~
@1394 = ~ There's a bucket of water over there to clean yourself with. That's it <SIRMAAM>. You'll soon get the mess off.~
@1395 = ~Cheer up Edwin. Green goes very well with red.~
@1396 = ~NOOO!!!~
@1397  = ~A good day to you too.~
@1398  = ~You get fresh meet in the city?~

@2013 = ~It definitely is.~
@2014 = ~[PC talking to a male] Would you coat this barrel with a fire proof layer from the inside? It needs to withhold a trapped fire elemental for a certain time.~
@2015 = ~Hmm, I *could* coat it with a thin metal layer from the inside but that would take some time as well as quite some amount of iron which is rather rare at the moment. Plus I'm not even sure it then would withhold the heat of a trapped fire elemental. Best you ask Matha - the fletcher, she knows her way around enchanting wood better than I could.~
@2016 = ~Once you *have* the fire proof barrel and are done using it, though, bring it to me because I have a good use of fire proof equipment. Bring it already filled with water from the well outside and I'll through in an extra 100 gold for not having to carry it myself!~

@2041 = ~Nah. You'll 'ave to talk to Cookie about that.~
@2042 = ~*giggle* Me boyfriend wouldn't like it. Nah. You'll 'ave to talk to Cookie.~
@2043 = ~*shriek* but you're a girlie!! Uhh - no. Talk to Cookie, go on.~
@2044 = ~'Oo - you're a dwarf. Cookie don't like dwarves.~
@2045 = ~What??~
@2046 = ~So what's new? I've heard that a few too many times for one lifetime.~
@2047 = ~Cookie don't like dwarves. You know - little hairy things like you. Says they're only here to steal her ale.~
@2048 = ~Go talk to her. I'm only the apprentice 'round here.~
@2049 = ~Wot I said before.~
@2050 = ~Some people 'ave got real cloth ears.~
@2051 = ~You talk to cookie an' see.~
@2052 = ~Yes, I noticed.~

//more lines for the cook
@2058 = ~You are aware that your boss is a dwarf, right?~
@2059 = ~You're a fine dwarf. A real fine one.~

// Noblemen
@2060 = ~The food here is very good - but then you wouldn't know that, would you? People like yourself would never be invited to a banquet here. Too far out of your social class, eh?~
@2061 = ~No, no, go away! You just can't get the staff these days, can you?~
@2062 = ~Just look at this place! Such a shame no-one knows what happened to Balduran, isn't it?~
@2063 = ~Call this a tower? I've seen better stables than this.~
@2064 = ~If you push me one more time, I'll be forced to gut you just for the fun of it, so I will!~
@2065 = ~Out of the way, peasant!~
@2066 = ~Have you seen the girls in the Blushing Mermaid? Such a deliciously wicked place!~
@2067 = ~Don't touch me! You might be carrying something contagious!~
@2068 = ~Go and get - oh! You're not one of the servants, are you? Be off then. I have no time for the likes of you.~
@2069 = ~Good food, good wine - what else can a man want! More gold, I suppose. More gold is always good.~

// Noblewomen
@2070 = ~Don't touch me, peasant!~
@2071 = ~Just look at the colours on these walls! Isn't it wonderful?~
@2072 = ~Oh the beds here are so divine! I could sink into one and sleep for a year.~
@2073 = ~You must taste the food here. I swear that cook has the touch of the gods about her.~
@2074 = ~I wonder what did happen to Balduran, hmm? Such a hero!~
@2075 = ~If this was my tower I'd soon do something about the guards. Such foul-mouthed ruffians!~
@2076 = ~Urgh - you smell like the midden heap back home. Be off with you!~
@2077 = ~What's that I smell? Peasant, is it?~
@2078 = ~I so wish I was alive when Balduran was alive - such an exciting time, yes? Do you think he would have married me?~
@2079 = ~If you see my husband you'll let me know, won't you? I'm trying desperately to avoid the drunken fool.~

// Almiran's Scroll
@2090 = ~You can:~
@2091 = ~Read the scroll.~
@2092 = ~Put the scroll away.~
@2093 = ~You try to read the scroll but the letters dance all over the surface of the parchment. In a few seconds you start to feel quite nauseous.~
@2094 = ~You feel stupid reading the scroll to a blank wall but at last the letters stay still!! As you read each letter it disappears in a tiny, barely-visible flash of light. When you come to the end of the scroll the parchment crumbles into a fine brown dust and vanishes for ever on the light breeze.~
@2095 = ~For a moment nothing happens, then the world dissolves around you.~
@2096 = ~You put the scroll away.~

// Alguine
@2100 = ~Well, you do seem to want to get yourself into trouble, don't you?~
@2101 = ~I thought you said there were no more nasty surprises around here?~
@2102 = ~Just get me out of here, mage!~
@2103 = ~Ah. I'd say this was more of a surprise rather than a nasty surprise, wouldn't you? There was nothing here trying to kill you this time.~
@2104 = ~Just get me out of here, please.~
@2105 = ~Just get us out of here, please.~
@2106 = ~Certainly. I've taken the precaution of closing that portal, you'll be pleased to hear.~
@2107 = ~But I thought you couldn't control the portals!~
@2108 = ~Tut, tut. You don't listen do you? I told you that I put the Nabassu here. Anyway, it won't happen again.~
@2109 = ~No, no! Go away and explore! There's lots to find yet.~
@2110 = ~Are you quite sure you've explored *all* of the Halls?~
@2111 = ~!!seirutnec owt tsal eht rof emoh ym ,seiromem Erutuf fo sllah eht ot Emoclew !gnol os retfa ynapmoc EmoS ees ot ma I desaelp s'tI !emoclew ,Emoclew~
@2112 = ~UH?~
@2113 = ~Er - pardon me??~
@2114 = ~Make sense man!!!~
@2115 = ~!esnes Gnikam ma i tub~
@2116 = ~What??~
@2117 = ~ - tnemom eno tiaw - thgir - seY !ho - Ahw~
@2118 = ~Is that any better? Yes, yes, of course it is - lots better. A bit of chaos to fight chaos, hmm? At least you'll be able to understand me for a while now. Let me introduce myself - I am Alguine the Mad.~
@2119 = ~The 'Mad'..?~
@2120 = ~That... doesn't sound so good.~
@2121 = ~Oh no. Not another mad mage. Keep away from me, do you hear!~
@2122 = ~Alguine the Maaadddd hahahahaha. Yes, yes, Alguine the Maaadd Maaadd Mage!!!!! Come to me my pretties - come to Alguine and feast on our new guests. Ohh, they'll be sooo sweeet and delicious!!! Come now to poor lost and lonely Alguine!!!! Haaaaooowwwwwhahahahaha!!~
@2123 = ~Uh uh...~
@2124 = ~On no, not again!!! Why is it always me??~
@2125 = ~I'm thinking I should be killing you right about now.~
@2126 = ~Ha! Got you! Actually, I'm not mad at all. But I am lonely. I've lived here backwards through time for the last two centuries and the lack of company does get a bit wearing after a while. Occasionally someone pops in but they never stay long. So, really, I'm pleased to see you.~
@2127 = ~I just couldn't resist the Mad Mage act though!~
@2128 = ~It's not a good way to make friends, you know.~
@2129 = ~It nearly got you killed!!~
@2130 = ~That, my new friend, would have been a blessing. But I'm not sure it is possible to kill me - believe me, I've tried.~
@2131 = ~Not possible to die?~
@2132 = ~No, I don't suppose it is really. But it was fun!~
@2133 = ~What do you mean - 'backwards through time'?~
@2134 = ~Well, the truth is that I'm cursed. I have no idea who is responsible for the curse but it's quite obvious that I upset someone extremely powerful. Maybe even one of the gods themselves. I don't know.~
@2135 = ~The curse forces me to live backwards through time. I wake one day and I'm old and wise and know everything; then day by day that knowledge slips away until I'm just a pewling, dribbling babe lying in a pool of fetid waste.~
@2136 = ~Do you know what it's like, knowing that each day you'll be a little more stupid than the previous day? No, I thought not. Why should you?~
@2137 = ~That's the power of the curse - I know what's happening even as it all slips away. Even that newborn babe knows it. But I can't find out who did it and I don't know how to break it.~
@2138 = ~For all I know the source of my misery is already dead and I'm condemned to this forever.~
@2139 = ~You seem remarkably cheerful despite that.~
@2140 = ~You probably deserved it. You don't get cursed like this for nothing.~
@2141 = ~Come now; that's hardly charitable, is it?~
@2142 = ~I'm not feeling charitable. Some idiot gives me a scroll, instructs me to travel to a camp full of vicious bandits and then tells me to read a bedtime story to a blank wall. Would you be charitable?~
@2143 = ~Well, if you put it that way, maybe not.~
@2144 = ~I'm telling you - definately not. And you have no reason to be cheerful either.~
@2145 = ~But I've grown used to this existance, otherwise I really would have gone mad. Or may be the curse won't allow me to go mad because that would destroy the sense of it? What do you think?~
@2146 = ~No, no, don't answer that. I did try to kill myself at first but I failed every time. It wasn't for lack of trying. A fireball, a few lightning strikes and a poisonous cloud all in the same place at the same time should have seen off almost anyone, shouldn't it?~
@2147 = ~But no, I spent a few days being sick, a few more days recovering from the burns and here I am again, hale and hearty.~
@2148 = ~Did you ever pick the scabs off your injured knees when you were a child, hm?~
@2149 = ~(Shudders) Where is 'here' anyway?~
@2150 = ~Yes I did actually. Why?~
@2151 = ~There's something oddly satisfying about doing that, isn't there? Anyway, welcome to the Halls of Future Memories.~
@2152 = ~The what??~
@2153 = ~The Halls of Future Memories. Some places you will recognise later; some you will think you recognise and others you will never visit. It all depends on choices, you see.~
@2154 = ~Choices?~
@2155 = ~Yes, choices. I think I know who you are but I'm not sure and I'm not sure I want to really know. I come from your future but I can't see that future because I'm trapped in this place. Feel free to wander around - I'm sure we'll meet up again somewhere in here. But for now... enjoy yourself in the Halls. And be careful of the portals!!~
@2156 = ~Hmmm. I see you've killed my pet demon.~
@2157 = ~Your pet demon??!!!~
@2158 = ~Well, not really my pet demon but I was becoming rather fond of him. He was one of my failed attempts to kill myself - I was able to summon him but after we found out that he couldn't kill me, I wasn't able to send him back to wherever he came from. Never mind. I did get the feeling that he didn't really like me.~
@2159 = ~Didn't... really... like... you?~
@2160 = ~That's what I said.~
@2161 = ~Are you going to tell *us* where they all lead?~
@2162 = ~That would rather spoil your fun, wouldn't it? Hold on while I sort this mess out... there, that should do it.~
@2163 = ~Yes. All except one which is a bit strange. There's a locked door there instead of a portal.~
@2164 = ~Oh yes. I have the key to that door. Normally I'd leave the door locked to keep out unwanted visitors but in this case... here you are.~
@2165 = ~Do you recognise this place? You should, you know. Or maybe not. How the wind howls from the far abyss!!~
@2166 = ~That's bit poetic isn't it? The 'far abyss'.~
@2167 = ~No - why should I recognise this place?~
@2168 = ~Oh - is it? Yes, I suppose it is. 'How the wind howls from the far abyss' - oh dear yes, very poetic. I didn't mean to sound like that at all.~
@2169 = ~As for recognising this place - no, I don't.~
@2170 = ~Ah yes - it is a future memory after all, so you shouldn't recognise it. Silly of me to think otherwise.~
@2171 = ~Do you know where we are?~
@2172 = ~You don't have a clue, do you? You're as lost as we are.~
@2173 = ~Hmph. Be like that.~
@2174 = ~I'm not sure. The portals can change their destinations depending on who my visitors are. Wherever it is, you may or may not ever go there. If you do go there it could look... different.~
@2175 = ~Different?~
@2176 = ~Different, yes. It's your future memory, not mine. Maybe it doesn't exist at all, but that's up to you to find out.~
@2177 = ~Who do the scales represent?~
@2178 = ~Kelemvor? Tyr? Who knows? Maybe I will know the answer in my past - or is that in my future? This is so confusing sometimes.~
@2179 = ~This place is so... empty.~
@2180 = ~They all are, wherever the portals lead too. Sometimes you can hear voices and sometimes it's just the wind rattling dust in a corner. But you can never feel the wind; have you noticed that?~
@2181 = ~Just the thought of it makes me feel cold. I think I'll retire to somewhere a little warmer.~
@2182 = ~Home, sweet home! The fire's always lit and the bed's always made.~
@2183 = ~By whom?~
@2184 = ~That sounds a bit spooky to me.~
@2185 = ~Who lives here?~
@2186 = ~No one. No one lives here. At least, I've never seen anyone here but the fire's always lit and the bed's always made.~
@2187 = ~You don't find that just a little odd?~
@2188 = ~I'd say my whole existance is a little odd, wouldn't you, hmm? This is one of the few places that doesn't seem to change much. This and the library.~
@2189 = ~The library?~
@2190 = ~Why don't you live here?~
@2191 = ~I did - for a while - but I found the fire always being lit and the bed always being made just a little unsettling. I tried throwing water on the fire and I stole the bedclothes but when I came back, the fire was lit and the bed was made. I didn't stay.~
@2192 = ~Oh. That is... a bit odd.~
@2193 = ~I'd agree with that sentiment. But now you're here, sit down and get warm.~
@2194 = ~Is it safe?~
@2195 = ~You haven't been there yet? You will, you will, trust me. It's a wonderful place.~
@2196 = ~About as safe as any place on the other side of a portal. That is to say, I don't really know.~
@2197 = ~Did you ever find out who is doing this?~
@2198 = ~Afraid of ghosts, are we?~
@2199 = ~No. If you will excuse me, I have things that I need to do.~
@2200 = ~OH! Now this is interesting! I've never seen this place before! Is that water I can hear?~
@2201 = ~Yes - there's a fountain in the other room.~
@2202 = ~You've never been here before?~
@2203 = ~If you've never been here before, how come you were able to follow me? Spying on me, are you?~
@2204 = ~If you've never been here before, how come you were able to follow us? Spying on us, are you?~
@2205 = ~A fountain! How delightful! I must go and take a look.~
@2206 = ~Wait a moment - you said you've never been here before?~
@2207 = ~Wait a moment - if you've never been here before, how come you were able to follow me?~
@2208 = ~Wait a moment - if you've never been here before, how come you were able to follow us?~
@2209 = ~No, I haven't. The portals don't always lead to the same places but after two centuries, it's getting rarer to see a new place.~
@2210 = ~How often do the portals change?~
@2211 = ~I don't know. They always change when someone new arrives but how often they change otherwise... your guess is definately as good as mine.~
@2212 = ~But they always lead back to the main Hall?~
@2213 = ~Not always. Sometimes one portal will lead to another and then you have a merry old time chasing your tail. Or my tail. Or somebody's tail anyway. Eventually you get dropped back into the Hall somewhere. At least, that's what's happened so far.~
@2214 = ~Eventually?~
@2215 = ~Eventually. Could be after one portal, could be after many portals. Not worth worrying about.~
@2216 = ~But if you've never been here before, how come you were able to follow me?~
@2217 = ~But if you've never been here before, how come you were able to follow us?~
@2218 = ~Ohh, that's no secret. A mage always knows where his guests are. Politeness and courtesy, you see; just in case they get into trouble.~
@2219 = ~Like a certain pet demon we had trouble with?~
@2220 = ~You don't have any more nasty surprises lurking around anywhere, do you?~
@2221 = ~That's very good of you.~
@2222 = ~I still think you're spying.~
@2223 = ~No more nasty surprises lurking anywhere. Or none that I know of anyway. I can't speak for whoever made this place though.~
@2224 = ~That's good news.~
@2225 = ~Just as long as you're not spying on me.~
@2226 = ~Just as long as you're not spying on us.~
@2227 = ~Come now - what do I gain by spying on you?~
@2228 = ~Not much, I suppose.~
@2229 = ~A way out of this place? And how do I get out?~
@2230 = ~A way out of this place? And how do we get out?~
@2231 = ~If there was a way out of this place for me I would have found it a long time ago. My guests always leave on their own but I have no idea when they are about to depart or what allows them to do so. You are in no danger from me.~
@2232 = ~Good.~
@2233 = ~I'd better not be.~
@2234 = ~We'd better not be.~
@2235 = ~That aside; you know, this place intrigues me. There has to be something in the library about it - I must go and look. Come and see me later.~
@2236 = ~Ah! The biggest tree on the Sword Coast!~
@2237 = ~How do you know that?~
@2238 = ~So say you. It just looks like just another tree to me.~
@2239 = ~Oh dear - you are a grumpy <PRO_RACE> today, aren't you?~
@2240 = ~I'm sorry. It's... just the whole situation. I don't know where I am or what I'm doing here and no idea if it will ever become clear.~
@2241 = ~I've got good reason to be.~
@2242 = ~So have I; probably moreso than you but I'm not grumpy. Look around you - what is there to be grumpy about? It's a beautiful place!~
@2243 = ~It might be to you but I doubt if it will ever be that way for me.~
@2244 = ~Listen: I just want out of here. I don't know what I'm doing here and I'm a little fed up with it.~
@2245 = ~Oh, don't worry about that. It will all become clear in time.~
@2246 = ~Will it now?~
@2247 = ~Why yes, of course it will!~
@2248 = ~For now, I'll take your word for it. Are you sure this is the biggest tree on the Sword Coast?~
@2249 = ~I don't say it is but there's a book in the library by Volothamp Geddarm that says so. If my memory serves me correctly, it's called 'Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast'.~
@2250 = ~Volo!!~
@2251 = ~Not Volo Geddarm! Not that idiot!!~
@2252 = ~You know the gentleman, do you?~
@2253 = ~Yes. He used to visit Candlekeep to talk to Gorion. Whenever Volo appeared Gorion and he would vanish into the Candlekeep library for days. I never got to see Volo and I really wanted to talk to him about his travels.~
@2254 = ~I know him alright. He used to come to Candlekeep when I was younger. I never did like him - puffed-up idiot.~
@2255 = ~Oh. I see. Well, that's where I got the story of the tree, true or not. Still, the day here is too good to waste, so I think I'll take a look around.~
@2256 = ~Ah! So you've found your way here at last!~
@2257 = ~I just went through the front door of a house and ended up in a forest!~
@2258 = ~Where's here, old man?~
@2259 = ~'Here', you grumpy, ill-tempered <PRO_RACE> is where I live, when the portal lets me.~
@2260 = ~Ha! Too often, I say.~
@2261 = ~You really are unpleasant, do you know that? I normally look forward to having visitors but with you, I look forward to your departure!~
@2262 = ~Okay, okay; I apologise. That was uncalled for and I should not have said it.~
@2263 = ~So do I.~
@2264 = ~That does it. Enough is enough.~
@2265 = ~Hmm. Your apology is accepted. Be welcome.~
@2266 = ~And I might be a grumpy, ill-tempered <PRO_RACE>, but I do have a name. It's <CHARNAME>.~
@2267 = ~Thank you.~
@2268 = ~Welcome <CHARNAME>. If you haven't found my library yet, it's through the door at the end of the corridor.~
@2269 = ~Another portal? I just went through the front door of a house and ended up in a forest!~
@2270 = ~You are welcome, truly. If you haven't found my library yet, it's through the door at the end of the corridor.~
@2271 = ~You found the hidden portal down on the dock, did you? Yes, that's one of the few stable ones. It always leads here.~
@2272 = ~And the entrance to your library? Why would I want to go there?~
@2273 = ~You found the hidden portal down on the dock, did you? Yes, that's one of the few stable ones. It always leads here. If you haven't found my library yet, it's through the door at the end of the corridor.~
@2274 = ~Your library? Why would I want to go there?~
@2275 = ~Maybe you don't. I just thought it might contain the answers to why you are here. You will let me know, won't you? Go on; the sooner you look, the sooner we'll know. I'll be along later - or is that sooner? Hmm.~
@2276 = ~Let me guess. You want to know where you are now?~
@2277 = ~Of course.~
@2278 = ~Do you really know?~
@2279 = ~If you know then tell me. I'm tired of being treated like an idiot.~
@2280 = ~Have you no patience?~
@2281 = ~None at all. Not now, not ever.~
@2282 = ~Then I pity you. Patience is a requisite part of daily life. Without patience, nothing would get done.~
@2283 = ~There are times, mage, when I would kill you if you would but stay dead!!~
@2284 = ~Just get on with it and tell me where we are.~
@2285 = ~Ah, but I won't, will I? So you be wasting your time, hmmm?~
@2286 = ~Maybe, but I'd also get some serious satisfaction out of trying!!! Now get on with it and tell me where we are!~
@2287 = ~I don't know. Well; that is, I'm not sure. You hear the voices? Ghosts that haunt a deserted port? Velen; I think. Velen in Tethyr. It's long been rumoured that the ghosts of the past haunt the present in Velen but no-one takes any note.~
@2288 = ~I hear voices, certainly. But whose voices?~
@2289 = ~Ghosts of the past? Does that mean they're dead?~
@2290 = ~So that's what they are. The dead who don't know they're dead.~
@2291 = ~The people that lived here. Or maybe the noise of the wind is playing tricks on our imagination.~
@2292 = ~So what you think it could be?~
@2293 = ~It's not the wind. Are these people all dead?~
@2294 = ~Not necessarily. They could be the voices of the living past being heard in the here and now. Who knows?~
@2295 = ~And there is no way of finding out?~
@2296 = ~You're starting to annoy me again, mage. What do you know about this place?~
@2297 = ~Magic lies heavy here where the Veil is thin. Past and present - and maybe your future - all mix here. How do we know that the voices are only voices of the past?~
@2298 = ~I don't. Do you?~
@2299 = ~More babbling. Is that it? You sound like one of the voices yourself.~
@2300 = ~No, I don't know either if they are voices of past or present. Velen was a naval outpost of Tethyr, protecting the inner lands against the pirates of the Isles of Nelanther. There was a strong fishing and seafaring community here, although if this is a true representation of Velen then there is little left of it now.~
@2301 = ~Wait - you said this is Velen. Now you say it's a representation of Velen!~
@2302 = ~I thought I told you how the portals work, hmm? Maybe I didn't. The portals show a part of the world but not it's not the real area itself. Even the people you see - if you see any at all - are only a ghost of themselves, but they are ghosts that feel and behave as if they are real. Almost as if we are on an ephemeral plane.~
@2303 = ~How do you know?~
@2304 = ~I don't.~
@2305 = ~Oh. So what makes you think that this is happening?~
@2306 = ~You don't?~
@2307 = ~Oh for - ! What in the Nine hells DO you know???~
@2308 = ~Not for certain. But I think I've found out.~
@2309 = ~Two centuries of research and visiting. Did I tell you that it can get quite lonely when there's no-one else here? Not much else to do, is there? Hmm?~
@2310 = ~And?~
@2311 = ~So you've read some books. So what.~
@2312 = ~I think I've done a bit more than just 'read some books' in that time.~
@2313 = ~What about it?~
@2314 = ~I draw conclusions and I test them. That's why I think the portals work as they do, but only the creators really know. And do *not* ask if I know who created the portals because I don't know. Not yet, anyway.~
@2315 = ~All that said, look around you. The port of Velen was not short of money in its time with all of those naval personel having nowhere else to go. Books in the library say that around here there were also shoals of fish of a type that didn't occur anwhere else on the Sword Coast. On a good day with a following wind it was possible to deliver the catch direct to Athkatla itself.~
@2316 = ~Those fresh cargos did fetch a pretty penny and made some of the more foolhardy captains very rich over time. Some day I would like to see more of this place, but for now, this is all you will get.~
@2317 = ~Ah! You're awake then!~
@2318 = ~Wha - what happened?~
@2319 = ~I was on my way to the library when I heard a cry and found you slumped on the floor. With the aid of a little magic I brought you back here and well - here you are.~
@2320 = ~I... I had a dream. A strange dream. I dreamed of Gorion and a voice that insisted that I do - things.~
@2321 = ~I have no idea. Your companion here came flying into my house demanding my immediate help. I must say, she was extremely insistant. We found you slumped on the floor in the library and brought you back here.~
@2322 = ~I have no idea. Your companion here came flying into my house demanding my immediate help. I must say, he was extremely insistant. We found you slumped on the floor in the library and brought you back here.~
@2323 = ~I have no idea. Your companions here say you just slumped to the floor in the library, so they brought you back here.~
@2324 = ~What things?~
@2325 = ~Things... no, you don't want to know about it. You just don't.~
@2326 = ~Very well; I won't ask further. Are you quite well now, <CHARNAME>?~
@2327 = ~I am. Thank you for your help.~
@2328 = ~You too, huh? *that* dream where Gorion appears in your bedroom at Candlekeep? Then you go to all those places? You don't want to know about it, Alguine. Trust me - you really don't.~
@2329 = ~Go on; the sooner you look, the sooner we'll know. I'll be along later - or is that sooner? Hmm.~
@2330 = ~Very well. It seems you saw everything there is for you here inside the future memories. They will all make sense eventually.~
@2331 = ~It was my pleasure to have you here. Now it is time for you to go. Fare well.~
@2332 = ~Hmm. I see you've got yourselves trapped up this corner. You really should be careful of those portals, you know. They could lead anywhere. Almost anywhere. But I know where they lead.~
@2333 = ~So, are you going to help us out of here or are we trapped now, too?~
@2334 = ~*As* I just happen to say I was not able to defeat the Nabassu, Fledgling or no, and that man's friend vanished too soon to sort out a plan. Also, young visitor, if you are as old as me - or should I say young? Hmmm... Anyway, if you lived that long you'll learn that everything sorts itself out eventually. As did this, see?~
@2335 = ~Who was that trapped man here? Why didn't you help him?~
@2336 = ~The Nabassu "didn't really like you"?~



// Assistant Winchman
@2400 = ~Yes?~
@2401 = ~Who are you?~
@2402 = ~I'm his assistant. If you want to know more about this place then best ask him. I only started here last week.~
@2403 = ~Didn't I just tell you that you'd be best talking to Brydw over there?~

// Head Winchman
@2410 = ~You don't really want that explanation all over again, do you?~
@2411 = ~Yes.~
@2412 = ~...No.~
@2413 = ~Hello. Nice day, innit?~
@2414 = ~Hello to you too. Who are you?~
@2415 = ~If you say so. What are you doing here?~
@2416 = ~No it's not a nice day. It hasn't been a nice day for months now.~
@2417 = ~Oh right. Shame that. I hope things improve soon. What can I do for you?~
@2418 = ~What is this place? What in all of Faerûn is that chain for?~
@2419 = ~I'm the head winchman here. Brydw's the name.~
@2420 = ~Head Winchman? What in all of Faerûn is that chain for?~
@2421 = ~That chain is to stop pirates and other undesirables from sailing into the harbour and sacking the city.~
@2422 = ~You see, when we gets warning that undesirables are sailing for the city, my assistant and I wind the chain up and block the harbour.~
@2423 = ~So the chain spends most of the time lying on the sea bed?~
@2424 = ~That's right. Ready and waiting, as you might say.~
@2425 = ~But doesn't it get rusty just lying there?~
@2426 = ~Well, yes, it does a bit. But we winds it up every few months, then we cleans off the seaweed and applies a new layer of grease to it.~
@2427 = ~Ah - I understand now. Thank you.~
@2428 = ~When's the next time? I'd like to see this!~
@2429 = ~Unfortunately, love, you've just missed it. That's what all the water is that's lying around here; me and my assistant have just wound the chain back out.~
@2430 = ~You can't wind it back up again just for me?~
@2431 = ~That's a pity. Well, thank you for the explanation.~
@2432 = ~Much as I'd like to help you, love, I'd rather keep what is really a nice cushy job. If you're staying here in the city the best I can do is to let you know when it's going to happen again.~
@2433 = ~I can't be sure that I'll be staying in Baldur's Gate much longer. Thank you for the offer.~
@2434 = ~Who are you?~
@2435 = ~What are you doing here?~
@2436 = ~Nothing, thanks.~
@2438 = ~Good day to you.~
@2439 = ~What exactly is the chain for?~
@2440 = ~If wound up, that chain protects the city from unwanted ships entering the city's harbor.~
@2441 = ~Hello again!~
@2442 = ~I have a Sea Troll's sebaceous gland for you.~
@2443 = ~For that, me and my assistant need to apply new layers of grease to it every few months. You look like adventurers. I'd be in need of grease, a very special sort.~
@2444 = ~Please don't tell me you want the grease of the geese from the kitchen.~
@2445 = ~So?~
@2446 = ~Ah, no, not that. And if, it'd be more of a wagon load full of gease.~
@2447 = ~I heard that in Tethyr they use tallow from Sea Trolls as it is especially water resistant. In case you ever come across such a creature, please bring the corresponding part to me - the sebaceous gland it is called I think.~
@2448 = ~Oh, how exciting! Thanks for going through the trouble. Here is some gold as compensation. I expect this to last for a while, but in case you'll find more, feel free to drop it off here. I'll take any you'll get.~
@2449 = ~Great! Here is your gold.~
@2450 = ~I have another Sea Troll's sebaceous gland for you.~

/* Girl and mom in Winchhouse */
@2455 = ~I'm waiting for the chain to be wound up again!~
@2456 = ~It smells of old fish and sea weet in here. As if the usual stink on the tower grounds wouldn't be stenuous enough already.~

// Tanner
@2500 = ~Ah, you again.~
@2501 = ~Do you have anything for sale?~
@2502 = ~I spoke to Captain Dungarth about your problems with the garrison soldiers.~
@2503 = ~Not today.~
@2504 = ~Yes?~
@2505 = ~Who are you?~
@2506 = ~What is this place? A tannery?~
@2507 = ~What is that awful stink in here?!~
@2508 = ~I'm the tanner. I produce all of the leather goods needed by the guards in the seatower.~
@2509 = ~So this is the tannery?~
@2510 = ~This is the tannery, yes. What else could it be?~
@2511 = ~But what is that awful stink in here!!?~
@2512 = ~Look - we've established this is a tannery. Tanneries always smell.~
@2513 = ~It smells like the back of the Blushing Mermaid at throwing out time. Or is that 'throwing up' time?~
@2514 = ~Look - this is a tannery. Tanneries always smell.~
@2515 = ~It smells like the back of the Low Lantern at throwing out time. Or is that 'throwing up' time?~
@2516 = ~Do you have anything for sale? The sooner I get out of this stink, the better.~
@2517 = ~Ha! Close enough in both ways.~
@2518 = ~It's all the same to me - it goes in one end, comes out the other and ends up in a bucket.~
@2519 = ~It does what?!~
@2520 = ~I don't believe you.~
@2521 = ~You have no idea how leather is made, do you?~
@2522 = ~No. How?~
@2523 = ~What I know is not important. Do you have anything for sale?~
@2524 = ~The skins arrive in here still covered in hair, so I wash them in clean water for a few days to get the worst of the dirt off, then if the animal hasn't been skinned properly I have to remove the remains of the fat and flesh with a sharp knife.~
@2525 = ~The skin goes into the tubs of night water for a few more days until the hairs get loose and I can scrape them off.~
@2526 = ~After that, I spend a few hours working washing salts into the skins to make the finished leather soft and supple. The type of leather you end up with depends on which animal the skin came from. Simple, eh?~
@2527 = ~If you say so.~
@2528 = ~Yes, I do say so, stupid <PRO_RACE>. We gnomes know exactly what we're doing!~
@2529 = ~I'm ashamed that you're a gnome if you didn't know something as simple as that! May Gond grant you enlightenment!~
@2530 = ~Ah, you again. You got passed those awful guards okay?~
@2531 = ~Yes, why?~
@2532 = ~They think it's good sport to make fun of us gnomes. The entrance to the tannery used to be through the East Tower but that was blocked up years ago after Nelanther pirates tried to capture the seatower. Now the only way down is the rope lift in Traitor's Tower.~
@2533 = ~Ah.~
@2534 = ~Yes, 'ah'.~
@2535 = ~One of these days I swear I'm going to find somewhere else to work - somewhere that appreciates good leather.~
@2536 = ~I could have a word with the garrison commander if that would help?~
@2537 = ~Tell me why he would listen to another gnome if he won't listen to me?~
@2538 = ~I'll try anyway.~
@2539 = ~Good point. Everybody ignores us anyway - until they need something they think only we can invent...~
@2540 = ~Hmm - with you being a <PRO_RACE> he might just listen to you. He certainly wouldn't listen to me.~
@2541 = ~Never mind. The chances are he wouldn't listen to me either.~
@2542 = ~As it happens, yes.~
@2543 = ~Oh yes? He isn't going to do anything, is he?~
@2544 = ~Just the opposite, in fact! He's promised to look into it and to make sure it doesn't happen again.~
@2545 = ~No.~
@2546 = ~Not quite, but not too far wrong. He says he'll have a word with the garrison soldiers but can't promise that it won't happen again.~
@2547 = ~I told you so.~
@2548 = ~Yes.~
@2549 = ~Now that's an unexpected and pleasant surprise! Thank you!~
@2550 = ~Now, as you're here, do you want to buy anything today?~
@2551 = ~That's about as good as I can expect, I suppose. Well, that's more than I ever achieved.~
@2552 = ~Never mind then.~
@2553 = ~The goods are over there.~
@2554 = ~Good day to you.~
@2555 = ~It does smell rather... strongly in here.~
@2556 = ~Why don't you enlighten me?~
@2557 = ~What of it?~
@2558 = ~One of their favourite tricks is to leave the winch suspended halfway down into the cave. Another is to just 'forget' that I'm here at all. After the second time they tried that I had the bed brought in by sea. It's never happened since.~
@2559 = ~I don't think there's anything I can do about that.~
@2600 = ~I didn't *expect* you to do anything about that! Captain of the Guard Dungarth is who'd need to clear his men's heads, but he certainly wouldn't listen to me.~
@2601 = ~I'll see what I can do.~
@2602 = ~I'm not interested in talking. Do you have anything for sale?~
@2603 = ~I need to get going.~
@2604 = ~Yes, but why?~
@2605 = ~That smell is the night water from most of the noble houses in Athkatla. For whatever reason legend has it that the night water from upper-class piss-pots is better for cleaning skins that the same product from the lower classes.~
@2606 = ~What do you use this for?~
@2607 = ~Maybe I just want to know how you do it.~
@2608 = ~Without going into more details - the stink does cover the whole tower grounds today. I might be in need to use this to spread a different fume.~
@2609 = ~The stink does cover the whole tower grounds today. I might be in need to use this to spread a different fume.~
@2610 = ~Well - let's say there might be something you could do for the Garrison Commander. The stink does cover the whole tower grounds today. I might be in need to use this to spread a different fume.~
@2611 = ~Maybe you are right.~
@2612 = ~Then thank you in advance for trying, I suppose.~
@2613 = ~I came for something else.~
@2614 = ~Because I am sure he's *not* all thankful and teary about my help with spreading that doppelganger magics. More realistic he'll try to turn that into a possibility to give me a warning about interfering with the tower's affairs!~
@2615 = ~Do you want to buy something?~
@2616 = ~I am here to bring you some liqueur.~
@2617 = ~Easy now, hold your attitute, alright?!~
@2618 = ~Or what? Are you gonna report me to the guards? Don't worry, they don't need your complaints to make my life miserable.~
@2619 = ~You want what?! I live on the brim of being kicked out from the tower completely as it is for just doing my work and now you want me to spread stink on *purpose*?!~
@2620 = ~The tower fights a doppelganger infestation currently. I have this liquid here that will draw them out if the fumes would be spread across the whole tower grounds.~
@2621 = ~Maybe it wasn't such a good idea. Do you have anything for sale?~
@2622 = ~Ah, so you thought "the tanner's stink is malfesting itself all over the tower anyway, so he can spread this additional stink, too"?!~
@2623 = ~Well... yes, actually.~
@2624 = ~You're predestined for this! All these years listening to the unfriendly remarks, and today of all days the wind direction, the inversive weather conditions - all perfect for this purpose to turn this into something useful! When will you have the opportunity to laugh into the captain's face again like this?~
@2625 = ~Spreading these fumes would help the tower guard, actually.~
@2626 = ~Could you? It needs to be done via fume, not by burning it. If we could just put it in whatever you are preparing currently...~
@2627 = ~So *you* say, but the Guard Commander will find something to blame me for afterwards, you can take my word for that!~
@2628 = ~...Please? It needs to be done via fume, not by burning it. If we could just put it in whatever you are preparing currently...~
@2629 = ~We'd just use one of your full tubs.~
@2630 = ~Ahh, this is just too good to be true! And yes, that was sarcasm!~
@2631 = ~WHAT?! You want to spoil one of my tubs with that stuff?~
@2632 = ~Well - duh?~
@2633 = ~I will compensate you for it.~
@2634 = ~Man, are you always that disobliging? The guard is fighting doppelgangers as we speak!~
@2635 = ~Look, it doesn't smell much for normal people. The smell is more irritating for doppelgangers.~
@2636 = ~It's irritating the hells out of me already, I tell you! I will not risk spoiling a whole load of my leather with that, no way!~
@2637 = ~Now explain to me again what I will get out of this?~
@2638 = ~You better help us now or you'll regret it, gnome!~
@2639 = ~Compensating? I hope you don't think you could just give me some gold and that's it. I need to treat my skins properly or they'll rot! I have orders to fulfill!~
@2640 = ~What would you want me to do as compensation?~
@2641 = ~What do you want then? Should I collect the night waters from the soldiers? Or maybe take a leak into that tub over there, eh?!~
@2642 = ~Yes, and I wish them all the good luck there is! I also understand that you don't *need* to spread these fumes to handle it!~
@2643 = ~Oh, what would you do? Kill me, the Seatower Tanner? You think you'd come away with this? Oh, or even better - go complain to the Guard Commander? (laughs bitterly) And what would that change, eh?~
@2644 = ~Ha! You wish.~
@2645 = ~I have enough night water. But I want compensation for the good stuff I put in there with it. Stop grinnin', I'm talking about liqueur. It makes the leather go softer - and it gives me a better smell while working on it.~ 
@2646 = ~Bring me three bottles of liqueur. It doesn't matter what, just something strong and more exquisite than your ordinary bottle of red wine.~
@2647 = ~Fine, I'll see what I'll find.~
@2648 = ~You mean something like this?~
@2649 = ~Listen. You either help us demask the doppelgangers on the tower grounds or I'll make sure you'll lose a lot more than one batch today.~
@2650 = ~Woah, woah, easy there! Fine, fine! I'll do it, now tone it down you unfriendly <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Being bullied by every bully, that's just my life's luck.~
@2651 = ~Don't make it cheap, you hear? Five hours of work for naught, and I'm sure the damn Guard won't even appreciate it!~
@2652 = ~Hmm! Yes, that looks good. Give that to me in a minute when I'm done *ruining* my perfect batch.~
@2653 = ~(sigh) Oh well. I surely hope Gond agrees to spoiling a good batch like this...~
@2654 = ~There you go. Let me know whether it worked. I can't wait to put it into the Guard Commander's face when next he'll complain about tannery stink.~
@2655 = ~Hm? Oh yes, I see.~
@2656 = ~"Herb Liqueur".~
@2657 = ~Not bad. Rich flavor.~
@2658 = ~"Calimshan Plum Liqueur".~
@2659 = ~That's a nice one indeed.~
@2660 = ~"Amnian Bitter Liqueur".~
@2661 = ~Yes, this will do.~
@2662 = ~Let me stow this away so the guard idiots don't see it when they come in here.~
@2663 = ~In case you stumble upon good liqueur, I would be interested in three bottles. It makes the leather go softer - and it gives me a better smell while working on it. It doesn't matter what, just something strong and more exquisite than your ordinary bottle of red wine.~

@2701 = ~Is there anything I can do here to help?~
@2702 = ~What is it that you do again? I thought the Captain of the Seatower was in charge?~
@2703 = ~I've been talking to the tanner and he tells me that he's being bullied by the guards.~
@2704 = ~Who are you?~
@2705 = ~Dungarth is my name - Captain Dungarth. I'm the Garrison Commander here.~
@2706 = ~What does the Garrison Commander do? I thought the Captain of the Seatower was in charge?~
@2707 = ~He is. My job is to organise the Tower Guards, make sure everyone behaves themselves and to re-unite lost children with whichever parent still wants them.~
@2708 = ~Now, unless you have anything urgent or pressing, I see that one of my sarjeantes is about to deliver me yet another lost child.~
@2709 = ~I'll be on my way.~

@2715 = ~There is a fire elemental in the kitchen's storeroom...~
@2716 = ~Oh? Fortunately, the storage room is rather damp - a fact normally not liked very much, but in this case it is to our advantage. Hmm, we can't let it rampage between all the crates and barrels...~
@2717 = ~No worries, I promised the cook to take care of it. I just wanted to let you know.~
@2718 = ~Yes, you should do something about it quickly I guess.~
@2719 = ~I'm at unease to see civilians do our work. The cook probably asked you because she's always cautious of my men coming near the alestore, be there a reason or not... Very well, I will respect her choice, but be sure to get rid of it quickly.~

@2730 = ~Good day to you.~
@2731 = ~Being left hanging in the rope lift, you say? Yes - I recall that. I was the one who freed him but I thought the problem was just you gnomes not being strong enough to pull yourselves up.~

@2853 = ~Let me see... hmmm... Thayan work I'd say by the way the letters dance on the page.~
@2854 = ~Can you read it?~
@2855 = ~Read it? Of course I can't read it! It's only meant to be read when you're standing in the right place to use it!~
@2856 = ~But where's that?~
@2857 = ~Patience, patience, young <PRO_RACE>. The young have no patience today. Ah! Got it! It's written by a wizard called Almiran and says something about some temple ruins in Peldvale.~
@2858 = ~Peldvale? There were some ruins near Tazok's camp, this must be it. Thank you, Halbazzar.~
@2859 = ~Oh, that's quite alright. Bring me the scroll back if it survives, will you?~

@2864 = ~Fine, I got it for free, too, and it's of no use to me any more, so here you go.~
@2865 = ~Then you'll have to find someone who'll give it back to you, because I'm only selling this.~
@2866 = ~Wonderful! This is very generous of you. Now I only have to find the time to actually travel there... Come back again, I might have something for you. Generosity needs to be rewarded.~
@2867 = ~You mean buy it now, give it to someone and have that person give it back to me? Hm, it's worth a try, unless you change your mind right now and give it to me for free?~
@2868 = ~No chance. I want to see gold.~
@2869 = ~Fine, fine! Here you go then. I'll give you 1000 gold for it, that should be the appropriate amount. Although this way, right now, it is completely worthless to *me*.~
@2870 = ~Ah, my generous adventurers. As I said, generosity should be rewarded. I'll be generous to you, too, although it will ruin my income for this month and more. Take this magical item, and it's a mere coincidence that the value maches the one of the scroll you gave me.~

@2922 = ~Let me see that. Ha! I recognise this work and very poor work it is too. A fool called Almiran wrote this. I could do better when I was barely an apprentice. The letters only stand still when you are in the place that the scroll is to be used! That is why you cannot read it, fool. Hmmm. Something about a ruined temple in Peldvale.

@3556 = ~Nobody knows what the mad sorceress looks like or what her name is. Lots of adventurers have tried to kill her but none have ever come back.~
@3557 = ~If you don't get killed by the mad sorceress then there's lots of doors on the Infinite Staircase that lead to other planes. Nobody's ever been there because they all get killed by the mad sorceress.~

@3563 = ~Stygia is the fifth circle of the Hells. Stygia is world made from a giant iceberg and is covered with snow and has blizzards blowing all the time. The river Styx runs through Stygia and all the other Hells (except those Hells that it doesn't run through).~

@3575 = ~Aglarond is full of magic and mysterious people. It sticks out into the Sea Of Fallen Stars and has Thay on the other side. Its capital is called Veltalar. The people of Aglarond don't like strangers.~
@3576 = ~Amn is really rich because it has lots of merchants. Amn was always having wars with Baldur's Gate but it never won them for very long. There are lots of mountains and fortresses in Amn such as the Cloudpeak Mountains and Crimmor. Athkatla is the main city of Amn and its streets are paved with gold. (Hmmm. If the streets are paved with gold how come the thieves haven't pulled them all up and sold them?)~
@3577 = ~Anauroch is a big desert and it's full of ruins where the Netherese cities fell out of the sky (I'd like to have seen the flying cities). Nobody really lives there.~
@3578 = ~Calimshan is full of Calishites. It has a swamp called the Swamp of Spiders and a big desert called the Calim Desert. They also have some moving hills called the Marching Mountains and their merchants make lots of money. Just like Amn really.~
@3579 = ~Cormyr is called the Land of the Purple Dragon but I don't know why it's called that. The capital is called Suzail and Cormyr is sometimes called the Forest Kingdom. It has a big lake in the middle called the Dragonsmere which leads to the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Cormytes are very clever because they have big beacons which they light when danger threatens and they tell everybody to go and hide until the invaders have gone away.~
@3580 = ~As you open the page a Kua Toan warrior seems to jump off the paper at you. You swear that you could hear his hissing warcry, so real does the drawing look.~
@3581 = ~Icewind Dale has ten different towns called the Ten Towns and is on the other side of the Spine of the World. Icewind Dale is very cold because it's always winter there. Easthaven is the most important town but Kuldahar is also very important. Kuldahar has a magic oak tree that keeps it warm. In all the other towns the houses have a fire to keep them warm, otherwise the people will freeze to death.~
@3582 = ~I don't know anything about Impiltur except that humans, dwarves and halflings all live together and it's a long way away.~
@3583 = ~Mulhorand is ruled by a lot of priests and has a lot of farmers. The capital city is called Skuld and the Mulhorandis have slaves too. The slaves are treated well but they all die of old age while they are still young. Mulhorand is famous for its horses which come from the Cliffs of Leaping Horses which aren't cliffs at all but huge wide-open grasslands.~
@3584 = ~The page is dominated by the head of what is obviously a blue dragon. The teeth and tongue look hungrily at you and the dragon's eyes stab flames into the dark. You shudder in admiration at the power of the pen that drew this.~
@3585 = ~Selgaunt is the capital of Sembia. It has a big temple dedicated to the war goddess Shar. Selgaunt is on the Sea of Fallen Stars and you can see the Pirate Isles from the top of the tallest towers. Sembia used to belong to the Netherese Empire until the cities fell out of the sky when it became independant.~
@3586 = ~Thay is full of Red Wizards because that is where they come from. It has a huge mountain in the middle called the Thaymount and the capital is called the Citadel. The Citadel is ruled by a cruel lich called Szass Tam. Thayans also have slaves like Mulhorand but the Thayan slaves aren't treated nicely at all. The Red Wizards are always trying to take over other lands but they never succeed. They think they're better than anyone else but they can't be because otherwise they'd rule all the lands.~
@3587 = ~It looks like the author of the book set out to list the lands that he/she had missed but gave up and scratched them out. At the bottom of the page a huge snake waits patiently for a meal to come within reach and in the top right corner a vulture circles endlessly.~
@3588 = ~Drow are black elves that live underground. Their home is called the Underdark. The Drow will melt in the sun so they can only go out at night.~
@3589 = ~There are lots of different types of Dwarves. Dwarves can live to 400 years old. Lady dwarves all have beards except when they shave them off.~
@3590 = ~Gnomes are very small like Halflings. They like building things and live in houses built underground. All gnomes are artists.~
@3591 = ~Halflings are very small like Gnomes. Halflings like singing songs and telling stories and are very brave.~
@3592 = ~Nobody likes Orcs because they are rough and nasty. They have grey or green skins and are always fighting. Orcs don't live in cities but camp out at night. They have lots of orc children who die young.~

@3700 = ~Greetings, I am Guoremor, the Abbot of this Ilmater Monastery. If there is anything we can help you with, please let us know. You are welcome to pray at the shrine, but please refrain from disturbing the monks inside their quarters.~
@3701 = ~You are the ones that found poor Martina. Yes, there is a lot of greed and evil in this world. We Followers of Ilmater try to do our best, but there is only so much we can do. Appearently, soldier Shuck had a lot of debts to pay for, so he forced his way to our collected alms, killing poor Martina in the process. Please, as a sign of our gratitude, take these scrolls. May they help you doing good.~
@3702 = ~If you haven't spoken to the Seatower Commander yet, I have word that he is looking for you. It is about the prisoner.~
@3703 = ~I see you bear injuries from your last battles, my friends. Did you come to call on my debts? Should I restore you to full health?~
@3704 = ~Yes, please do so, and thanks.~
@3705 = ~No, not today. I'll spare that for another day.~
@3706 = ~With pleasure. Please wait until I am finished.~
@3707 = ~There, all of you should be as good as new. Ilmater's Blessing be with you.~
@3708 = ~Welcome again.~
@3709 = ~Well... we would have a task for a group of fearless adventurers. There is evil inside the tower's catacombs, and usually we monks of Ilmater take care it does not accumulate to a point where it cannot be handled properly. Unfortunately, due to recent events we were not able to do our incantations regularly and now we are not sure what has manifested inside. We would need someone with the necessary capabilities to go into the inner sanctuary and see what they can find.~ 
@3710 = ~What do you think would await me there?~
@3711 = ~I'll do it.~
@3712 = ~What would be the reward?~
@3713 = ~I'm not interested.~
@3714 = ~We call it the restless spirits. Skeletons, mainly... but maybe even something much darker. You should prepare to fight against undead.~
@3715 = ~Wonderful. This takes a huge burden off our shoulders. The first tomb presents no danger, but do not go into the catacombs hastily, and please respect the rest of the dead, or there will be consequences - not from us, but from the restless dead themselves.~ 
@3716 = ~I will give you two keys. The first one is for the catacombs itself, but only we monks have the key for the inner sanctuary where the evil arises. You need to find the hidden door. Walk through it and be prepared to face great evil. I will give you one reward right away, because it would be foolish not to.~
@3717 = ~We do not have much to give, but I will forward you a gold reward from the Tower Captain, as well as some scrolls and potions from our fund.~
@3718 = ~Ah well, this would have been too easy for us, ha. Then we will deal with this ourselves later. Until then, the catacombs will stay locked so there won't be any danger for the common folk. Please be so kind and do not spread the rumor, least it stirrs a panic - or attracts fearnoughts to endanger themselves.~
@3719 = ~Is that so! You are a good person for bringing it here, my friend. Do you happen to know how much exactly is left?~
@3720 = ~I do, as a matter of fact. It was 1467 gold exact.~
@3721 = ~No, I took the gold from where it was hidden by the thief and brought it here.~
@3722 = ~Something around 1500 gold, I think.~
@3723 = ~Do you expect me to count that for you?~
@3724 = ~No, I don't. How much was the whole sum, if I may ask?~
@3725 = ~I'm the abbot of this monastery. We are followers of Ilmater, the Crying God.~
@3726 = ~Is there anything else I can do for you?~
@3727 = ~I have here what is left of the alms that were stolen by the soldier.~
@3728 = ~What a pity so much gold was stolen from your monastery. Especially pitiful that it will never be recovered.~
@3729 = ~The priestess of Selune said you have some troubles in the catacombs worth for an adventurer?~
@3730 = ~Is there anything more you'd need help with?~
@3731 = ~About the task you offered me - I would be ready to do it now.~
@3732 = ~We had a... chat with the restless dead in the catacombs.~ 
@3733 = ~What do you do here?~
@3734 = ~Thank you and good day to you.~
@3735 = ~Is that so! What exactly did you find?~
@3736 = ~A skeleton which proclaimed to be the ruler of the dead manifested in the inner sanctuary and said curious things about my father.~
@3737 = ~There is a talking skeleton in the inner sanctuary. I couldn't fight it, though, it only sends it minions.~
@3738 = ~If you treat carefully, be polite and do not disturb the rest of the dead, the catacombs should be safe.~
@3739 = ~Indeed? Interesting. This should suffice until we are strong enough to do the usual cantations again. You did us a great deed, indeed. Let me give you your reward, you earned it. Ilmater's mercy be with you.~
@3740 = ~Ah, so it is more than half of what we collected.~
@3741 = ~No, no of course not.~
@3742 = ~It was an unusually large sum we raised by a charity event here, inside the tower. A lot of wealthy folks like to spend their time here, as the atmosphere is a very special one. Originally, it was a total over 2000 gold...~
@3743 = ~...2068, to be exact.~
@3744 = ~...2067, to be exact.~
@3745 = ~2068... that makes a difference to 601 to what was left. 1 gold coin for the beggar in front of the Ilmater's Shrine... and probably 600 with which Shuck tried to pay off the debts.~
@3746 = ~Impressive, for times like these.~
@3747 = ~Aha.~
@3748 = ~(sigh) Yes, poor Martina didn't come far with her round that day...~
@3749 = ~I sincerely hope the gold did good wherever it was spent. If only Soldier Shuck would have talked to us instead of forcing his way to it... much would be different. There is always a way without violence.~
@3750 = ~Thank you for bringing it, my friend. Please, do undestand that I will not offer you any gold or item as a reward in this case, as no mundane reward would be appropriate. But next time you come here all bruised and battered, I will bestow my god's blessings on you without taking your gold for it.~
@3751 = ~It is. People want to do good, if they are shown a way how to do so with their own means.~
@3752 = ~Yes, it is sad. So the prisoner spent it all, hm? Sad, really. Thank you for letting me know.~
@3753 = ~The restless spirits in the catacombs was all we needed help with. I'm afraid there is nothing more from our side.~

@10010  = ~Yes, the man downstairs said you are supposed to pick up the boy he is travelling with.~
@10011  = ~If I am assuming correctly, you are the woman who is suposed to adopt young Lars who is waiting with his attendant downstairs?~
@10012  = ~So, sure I can't help you with that boy downstairs?~
@10013  = ~Good day to you, too.~
@10014  = ~Ah, does he tell the whole inn now... wonderful. I apologize, this was by no means addressed at you, specifically. That man is not the best choice for this obligation, but there is not much I can do, I did not enlist him with the task. (sigh) Noone did, actually, not from our family, that is. See, the child is my deceised daughter's son - my grandson.~
@10015  = ~Yes, yes, I know - "why does she not fly down the stairs and take that poor child into her arms?" Well, it's not that easy. It never is. But this is no business to bother you with, my good <PRO_LADYLORD>. You do not need to burden yourself with such matters.~
@10016  = ~On the contrary, I'd be delighted to help in any way.~
@10017  = ~It does sound like an intriguing story, to be honest.~
@10018  = ~Indeed. Farwell.~
@10019  = ~That is very kind of you, but I wouldn't know how... Other than listening to my woes and tell me whether I am a silly old hag who should come to her senses!~
@10020  = ~A story... yes, it indeed is one.~
@10021  = ~See - my daughter, my one child, fell in love with a man who... who treated her badly. He made her obedient and made her rejecting me, I knew she suffered but there was not much I could do. Now my daughter died, that man is nowhere to be found, and I... I am scared.~
@10022  = ~I am scared that boy looks like him. That I look into his face and see the man who maltreated my Silvia, who is responsible for her withering away. I... I couldn't stand it. I would make him suffer for what he did, although I know that child is innocent. I just... I can't.~
@10023  = ~You mean you didn't really see him until now?~
@10024  = ~He's right downstairs. Why not go down and have a look? Maybe he looks completely different!~ 
@10025  = ~You are a silly old hag who should come to her senses!~
@10026  = ~You should feel responsible for your grandson, no matter the looks.~
@10027  = ~Ah well, I wouldn't care about one brat, either. Good day to you.~
@10028  = ~...I beg your pardon?~
@10029  = ~That's what you said I should call you, remember?~
@10030  = ~It's not necessarily my opinion, I just wanted to say that to a complete stranger once!~
@10031  = ~So you think I should go downstairs and act like a responsible grandmother?~
@10032  = ~Absolutely!~
@10033  = ~Do you have to take him in if you don't like him? There are foster homes, as well.~

@10038  = ~No, his hair is more dark brown-ish, actually.~
@10039  = ~(lie) Yes, black as night with bats and crows in it!~
@10040  = ~I don't remember.~
@10041  = ~I know it's a bit much, being drawn into a stranger's problems so. But...~
@10042  = ~Oh... And his eyes, are they more blue... or grey?~
@10043  = ~Hm... more grey, I think.~
@10044  = ~(lie) Blue, definitely.~
@10045  = ~I really don't remember.~
@10046  = ~Blue eyes...~

@10048  = ~Hm. I need to have a look into that boys eyes.~
@10049  = ~Black hair and blue eyes... that is *him*, that is him... No, I can't stand it, I will not face this child... I thank you, stranger, for your help. I will take care of that boy, but not in my house. I need to leave.~
@10050  = ~Could it be...~
@10051  = ~I thank you, kind <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I will go downstairs. I finally found the courage!~
@10052  = ~There you are! You wonderful, kind <PRO_LADYLORD>! Can you imagine? My grandson! He looks just like my son!~

@10061  = ~This... This boy is of my flesh and blood. He is my grand-son!... I... I thank you for bringing me to him, <PRO_LADYLORD>. I *thank* you.~
@10062  = ~Grandma? I draw a picture for you.~
@10063  = ~Oh, how nice.... But oh, I didn't bring anything for you! Can you imagine? How about.. how about we go to the carnival and have a huge bag of sugared almonds, hm?~

@11009  = ~The corner is damp, and a small spore colony is growing in it, covering half of the wall.~
@11010  = ~You destroy the hostile spore colony, reveiling an opening in the walls.~
